# SimilarityNetworkFusion
This is an implementation of the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) method ([Want et. al, Nature Methods 2014][1]) in Julia. This is not an official
implementation, as I'm not part of the authors of the paper. But, I followed
the implementation provided by the authors in R and translated it to Julia.
